## Cookbook

The purpose of this application is to create a full stack application using docker containers to store the various parts of the application, as well as to set up a Devops pipeline to build and deploy the application to a staging environment for testing purposes.

The backend is a Flask API, connected to a MySQL database for authentication and content storage, and the frontend is a React Vite SPA with CSS/Flexbox for styles. 
Each of these will be run inside their own docker containers.
